WARNING: [Route 35-419] Router was unable to fix hold violation on pin synchronizer_25_175/clk_target_q1_reg/D driven by global clock buffer BUFGCTRL_X0Y0.
Resolution: Run report_timing_summary to analyze the hold violations.

Phase 10.1 Update Timing | Checksum: 1c88f073b

Time (s): cpu = 00:00:23 ; elapsed = 00:00:17 . Memory (MB): peak = 2885.336 ; gain = 139.344 ; free physical = 8722 ; free virtual = 13163
INFO: [Route 35-57] Estimated Timing Summary | WNS=-8.683 | TNS=-1269.392| WHS=-2.438 | THS=-2.438 |

WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.
