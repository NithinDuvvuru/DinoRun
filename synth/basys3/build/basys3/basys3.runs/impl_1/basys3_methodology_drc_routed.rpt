TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock mmcm_100_to_25_175/inst/clk_100 is defined downstream of clock clk_100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition

No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_100 and clk_25_175_mmcm_100_to_25_175 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_100] -to [get_clocks clk_25_175_mmcm_100_to_25_175]

Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mmcm_100_to_25_175/inst/clk_100 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mmcm_100_to_25_175/inst/clk_100. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.681 ns between game_synchronizer/sync_data_q_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_100) and dinorun/dino/_45_/Q_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk_25_175_mmcm_100_to_25_175). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#190 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.683 ns between game_synchronizer/sync_data_q_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_100) and dinorun/dino/_45_/Q_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk_25_175_mmcm_100_to_25_175). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
